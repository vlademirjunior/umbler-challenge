# Why the "constants" directory?
~~~~
- The use of constant is very important for you to be able to centralize a return word of error, success, HTTP status, name of an entity that is repeated by several parts of the code because when there is a change of value in that constant all parts that they use will be changed without having to look in each file for the project.
