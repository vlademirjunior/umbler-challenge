# BACKEND - Umbler Challenge

## Main objective of this architecture.
- To do unit tests will be much easier, without the need to make a request to an endpoint.
- Code reuse in other classes.
- Easy maintenance, as we will granulate our responsibilities and etc..., (Google search on SOLID).

## Other pattern used
#### DTO - Data Transfer Object Pattern
- The definition for DTO can be found on Martin Fowler's site. DTOs are used to transfer parameters to methods and as return types. A lot of people use those in the UI, but others inflate domain objects from them.
- Source: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html

## Others principles used
#### KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
- This principle states that you should always keep your code simple. If you have a complex piece of code, always try to break it into smaller more maintainable code.

#### YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
- This principle states not to implement something until it is necessary. This is a piece of advice every developer should follow.

#### DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) *** Business rules ***
- This principle is crucial for writing simple and easy-to-modify code.
- The opposite of DRY code is WET code: write everything twice.
- You can create a common function or abstract your code to avoid any repetition in your code.

#### SoC (Separation of Concerns)
- SoC principle is all about minding your own business, literally.
